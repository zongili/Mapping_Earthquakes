# Geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL - Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose:
Using Leaflet.js API to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. Each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. Using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and adding the data to a map is the main purpose of the project.
### Tools: 
JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data. a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website.
## Analysis:
sifted through data provided by U.S. Geological Survey to create a visulaization to map earthquake  data by latitude and longitude. With CD3, created a scatter plot comparing two different variables. created sophisticated plots by using all of the data provided and using an interactive plot.



•	Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
•	Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
•	Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
•	Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
•	Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
•	Render maps on a local server.

## Summary:
In summary this project visually shows the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
